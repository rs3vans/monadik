A [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) library which provides some common functional monads.

## Overview ##
This library is a simple set of tools that allow a developer to apply functional
monads to their code.

## Motivation ##
Functional programming (FP) is by no means a "silver bullet". That said, often times
when we apply functional concepts to our code, we end up with code that is easier to
reason about, and easier to test. This library draws from existing concepts in other
languages like Scala.
